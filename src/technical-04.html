									<p><strong>Motor shaft must be free from sharp edges and mechanical discontinuities:</strong> Ensure that the selected shaft location for the ring is smooth and free from any keyways, balancing holes or the like.</p>
									<p>Motor shaft must be conductive: Shaft must be clean and free of any coatings, paint, corrosion, or other nonconductive material (clean to bare metal). Depending on the condition of the shaft, it may require using emery cloth or Scotch-Brite™. Once the shaft is visibly clean, a non-petroleum-based solvent may be used to remove any residue. If possible, check the conductivity of the shaft using an ohmmeter.</p>

									<p>If possible, adjust or change spacer and screw lengths to avoid the keyway, or fill the keyway (in the area where the AEGIS® microfibers will be in contact with the shaft) with a fast-curing epoxy putty such as Devcon® Plastic Steel® 5 Minute® Putty. Ensure smooth transition at edges of epoxy and shaft.</p>
									<h5>Basic Surface Resistance Test</h5>
									<p>Place the positive and negative meter leads on the shaft where the microfibers will contact. Each motor will have a different reading, but in general, you should have a maximum reading of less than 2 ohms anywhere you check the shaft. If the reading is higher, clean the shaft again and retest.</p>

									<h5>AEGIS® CS015 Colloidal Silver Application:</h5>
									<p><i>Recommended for all applications.</i>The safety Data Sheet with PPE information is available for download.</p>
									<p><img src="@img/protect/03.png" alt="Image" class="float-img"> If possible, gently warm the shaft when the AEGIS® CS015 will be applied. This helps the CS015 cure faster. Allow CS015 to come to room temperature prior to opening. Thoroughly stir the silver coating. Apply a thin, uniform coat of the AEGIS® Colloidal Silver Shaft Coating to the area where the AEGIS® microfibers will be in contact with the motor shaft. Apply all around the shaft. Wait for the first coat to dry to a tack free surface. Drying can be accelerated with the use of gentle heat from a heat gun, but don’t exceed 200°F (93°C) while curing. Apply a 2nd thin, uniform coat of CS015. Allow CS015 to dry to a tack free surface before installing the AEGIS® Ring. Allow the CS015 to cure completely before running the motor. The coating will cure at room temperature in 16-20 hours or in about 60 minutes at 200°F (93°C).</p>

									<i>Take care when handling the ring. Do not crush fibers.</i>
									<p>Install the AEGIS® SGR so that the aluminum frame maintains an even clearance around the shaft. AEGIS® conductive microfibers must be in contact with conductive metal surface of the shaft. Care should be taken when handling the ring to prevent fiber damage during installation.</p>

									<h5>Recommended: <a href="">AEGIS® HFGS High Frequency Ground Strap</a></h5>
									<p>When installing HFGS, ensure metal-to-metal contact at both terminals by removing paint or corrosion (down to clean, bare metal) at the motor foot and the ground location. Secure tinned end to motor foot. Secure ring terminal to metal ground.</p>
